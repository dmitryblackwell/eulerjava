# Euler on java

### Introduction
This code represent project Euler on Java. It contains 611 tasks and I will solve them in next year or so(I hope). 
Also it contains 10 tasks that not solved by humanity and I hope I will solve them to (Let's pray for it together).
All problems are divided on levels, there are 25 problems in one level. It gets totally 25 levels.

# Problem Overview
###Problem_003
We find a prime number by Miller-Rabin primality test. Not sure how the fuck it is working, but it does. Than in the for-loop we divide our huge number on integer: 2,3,4...etc If 
remainder of the division equals 0, we check if it is primal or not.
